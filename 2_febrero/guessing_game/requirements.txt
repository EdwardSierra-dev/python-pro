🏗 Step 1 — Basic Version (Core Logic)

Before I give you the full solution, I want you to think like a developer.

Questions:

How do we generate a random number between 1 and 100?

How do we keep asking the user until they guess correctly?

How do we count attempts?

Answer those quickly in code form (even if imperfect).

If you prefer, we can also build it together step-by-step.

Your move, dev. 🚀
